		<h2>Understanding Linear Algebra</h2>

		<p>Linear algebra is a tool that is widely used in engineering and the sciences. It can
        be used in computer graphics to transform a scene to an orientation that can be projected
        onto the screen. Linear algebra can be used to model the vibration of structures or predict
        the current and voltage in an analog electric circuit. It can be used to predict the orbital
        shapes of an electron. The uses of linear algebra a diverse, and a good understanding of
        linear algrbra can be useful for understanding its applications.</p>
		
        <p>One of the challenges to understanding linear algebra is that there are a lot of 
        computations, typically performed using matrices and vectors. The typical course presents 
        the method for performing computations, but spends little time helping the student develop
        intuition as to what the computations mean. As opposed to calculus where you shown graphically 
        what a derivative is, or vector algebra where you are shown how vectors can be added or 
        subtracted and are provided graphical representation of dot products and cross products, in 
        linear algebra it is common to include few graphical representations. When graphical 
        representation are provided, a student is not always provided with the insight to be able to 
        relate the picture to the matrix used to derive the picture. As a result, you might feel as
        lost in a sea of computation as I did when I first learned linear algebra. I could perform
        the computation, but I had little idea of what kind of results to expect.</p>
        
        <p>The lack of graphical representation in linear algebra is unfortunate because many of the
        fundamental concepts of linear algebra have simple and intuitive graphical representations
        that can provide a student with useful insights. The objective of this material is to
        provide the student of linear algebra with some understanding of the graphical foundations
        of linear algebra so that they can more effectively understand some of the core principles of
        linear algebra.
